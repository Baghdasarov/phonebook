# PHP

## Create virtual host (root folder is /API/)
### http://vue-php.loc host is set by default. If you prefer another host name, find
axios.defaults.baseURL = 'http://vue-php.loc';
### row in phonebook/src/main.js file and change to yours.
## Create DB
### Before creating check DB parameters in API/app/config/config.php file and make changes if need.

# VUE

## Project setup
```
cd phonebook
npm install
npm run serve
```
####Mostly after these commands you will get
####http://localhost:8080
####or
####http://localhost:8081
####URL for project. That's what you need. Have a good time :)

Will be appreciated if a feedback be given.
Thanks.
